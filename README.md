# imagemagickBat
Batch File 4 Mass Imageconversion in Windows and Portable (or installed) Imagemagick

I prefer the portable version from https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php

Download the correct ICC File from http://www.eci.org/de/downloads

and copy it next to the batchfile

Fix your Paths in identifyprog and magickprog

choose your Original Path

and final SEARCHTEXT and REPLACETEXT

and correct "eciCMYK.icc" in "%magickprog%" call.



Call Convert2cmyk.bat from commandline, or doublecklick.

Happy CMYK conversion, or whatever you want from magick
